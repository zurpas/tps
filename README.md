Download files by clicking the "Release" on the right side of the page and following the instructions It should be labeled something like "v1.0.0) Mods, Configs, Cache, etc.".

Description:
This combined release includes both the main mod files and cache files, the cache files are intended to speed up the initial setup process. However, due to the large size of combined files and limitations with GitHub, the cache files have been split into a separate asset.

Instructions:

    Delete the BepInEx and user/mods folders. (keep the user folder, you're only deleting the "mods" folder inside of the user folder.)

    Download both "cache_(Version).zip" and "tps_(Version).zip" from the releases section and extract the contents into your game root directory. You can overwrite files if prompted.

    From now on, start the launcher/game with the "!StartGame.bat" file to automatically check for updates.

Note:
While the cache files are optional, downloading them significantly reduces load times. If you opt-out, you'll be waiting for quite some time if you're joining a different host. I recommend downloading both assets for the best experience.
